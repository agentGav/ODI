**Communications policy and guidelines**

**1. Purpose**

To ensure that the ODI’s mission, vision and values are consistently communicated across its global network.

**2. Scope**

All ODI Nodes

**3. Priorities for ODI’s communications strategy**

1. Creating and telling great stories about open data impacts - Producing compelling, evidence-based stories that celebrate the economic, environmental, and social impacts of open data.

1. Clear differentiation -  Establishing the ODI's role and vision as distinct from others in the open data space, while demonstrating an enthusiasm for collaboration with existing and new networks.

1. Demonstrating leadership - Showing leadership in the open data movement, creating mechanisms to drive the agenda in repeatable, scalable ways.

1. Enabling to everyone - Aiding data literacy and a building deep understanding of 
open data and its potential.

**4. Communications tools** 

To achieve this, we use a range of communications tools including
		
- One to one meetings
- Meetings, events, and lectures
- Social events, including hackathons
- Cultural actions (e.g. data-driven art commission)
- A strong, dynamic brand
- Newsletters, direct mailing, blogs and news stories on our website
- Social media
- Media
- Advertising

**ODI benefits from**	

- Having one person to coordinate and manage all public communications. Although everyone gets involved, this person is responsible for safeguarding the ODI’s reputation as their main objective.
- The CEO and leadership teams take an active, personal interest in communications: they are ODI’s main spokespeople. The CEO has a strong direct relationship with the person who manages communications.
- Planning all our communications carefully, defining our audiences, messages and channels to deliver the **impacts** we are seeking. 
- Messaging is consistent and coherent across all communications (both internally and externally to ensure everyone is aligned)
- Using simple, elegant language, avoiding jargon and using good grammar.
- Building and maintaining a strong image and brand across media, social media, digital platforms, and all other communications. ODI have defined guidelines to ensure consistency in both **design** and **tone of voice**.
- Viewing media as an opportunity to help communicate the impact, vision, work and decisions of the ODI. We engage with journalists in the tech media, and business, consumer and public sector press
 

**5. Communications Principles**

- Be thoughtful, firm, and clear - never impulsive, vexatious or confrontational
- No personal disagreements or grievances in public places - online or offline
- Holding those to account - where we think something is wrong, unethical or ill-conceived - we may say so and **recommend** or **offer solutions**
- No materials are designed to affect public support for a particular political party or group or contain material that is disparaging of a particular political party, or group, or their individual members
- Do not promote, endorse or recommend particular companies, products or services. 
- Do make positive announcements about organisations that are joining the ODI as members, partners or affiliates, and showcasing their open data projects and impacts.
