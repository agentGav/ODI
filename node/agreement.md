**Version: January 2016**

General comment is that there is still quite a bit of work to do on this doc.  I am not happy with it as is, we need to tidy up what ODI’s intentions are and then push across for legal review again. I am also not happy with the legal review it has been through.  I have checked it but not in any great detail – spent about an hour on it.  I would suggest next steps are LB/GS/AP meet to discuss this is more detail to ensure we are aligned. Then we can push for legal review.
