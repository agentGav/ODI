# General policy : Supplier engagement and procurement

1. Summary

   1. ODI operates open procurement and financial processes.
   1. The Procurement Threshold is set at £5,000.

1. Procurement principles

   1. ODI will solicit bids from at least three (3) companies for all supplier contracts over the Procurement Threshold. Suppliers will be approached, or an open tender published, depending on the needs of the business or specific nature of the work.  For open tender invitations these will be published on our website.  Suppliers can be UK or internationally based.

    1. Potential suppliers will be assessed by more than one ODI team member, based on a scoring metric of 1 to 5 (5 being excellent):

		1. Quality of service;
		1. Price competitiveness;
		1. Commitment to Open Data, its culture and community;
		1. Environmental policies;
		1. Social policies; and
		1. Communications expertise.

	1. ODI will use expertise from relevant team members when assessing quality (e.g. technical bids will be assessed by the ODI technical team).  Whilst the award of a contract combines scoring across all of the above criteria, we highlight commitment to open data as a very important factor.

	1. Contracts of lower than the Procurement Threshold may also be subject to competitive tender based on the nature of the work.

1. Authority and sign-off

   1. Sign-off on all spending under or above the Procurement Threshold requires the sign-off of either:
 
		1. The CEO and the Director of Finance and Compliance; 
		1. The Chairman and the Director of Finance and Compliance;
		1. The CEO and one member of the Senior Management team; or
		1. One member of the Senior Management team and the Director of Finance and Compliance

1. Open data principles

	1. We reserve the right to publish information such as our supplier’s names, the cost of services we have purchased, and related service provision metrics at ODI’s sole discretion. 

	1. For example, with an IT contract we may make Service Level Agreement terms and the suppliers performance against these terms available as Open Data. With a time and materials contract, we may make available the total value of the contract and the name of the supplier. ODI will not make available data which may be considered personal data: for example, the day rate of an individual freelancer.

	1. Where relevant, open data relating to service provision must be supplied to at least Open Data Certificate **Standard** level. Details of this standard can be found at https://certificates.theodi.org/

	1. Providers should provide relevant information as open data as part of their contract. The ODI reserves the right to re-publish such information as open data. The purpose of this is to help secure the most effective services and to maintain quality of service. One supplier benefit is that those providing the best services will gain the greatest positive exposure.

	1. We expect at least the following information to be supplied as Open Data:

		1. Contract information: 
Financial terms, key dates (for example renewal dates, key deliverable dates), and service level agreement terms.
		1. Performance data: 
Where relevant, the service level and performance metrics against which the service will be monitored and assessed, and the actual performance data against those metrics.
		1. Data assets:
Any and all relevant data assets howsoever created under contract with the supplier must be made available in a timely manner under an open license.
